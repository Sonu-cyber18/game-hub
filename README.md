# game-hub
The Game Hub is a web-based gaming platform that hosts 12 interactive games in a single application. When a user visits the website, they are required to sign up or log in before accessing any game. Each user has a unique username and password, ensuring personalized and secure access.

The authentication system controls access to the platform, allowing only registered users to play games. Once logged in successfully, users can explore and play multiple games such as Chess, Level Devil, Snake, Flappy Bird, and other fun arcade and logic-based games from the game hub.

This project focuses on user authentication, game integration, and smooth gameplay experience within a single platform.
